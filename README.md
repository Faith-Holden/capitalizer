# capitalizer

My solution for Chapter  Exercise  of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
To “capitalize” a string means to change the first letter of each word in the string to upper
case (if it is not already upper case). For example, a capitalized version of “Now is the time
to act!” is “Now Is The Time To Act!”. Write a subroutine named printCapitalized
that will print a capitalized version of a string to standard output. The string to be printed
should be a parameter to the subroutine. Test your subroutine with a main() routine that
gets a line of input from the user and applies the subroutine to it.
Note that a letter is the first letter of a word if it is not immediately preceded in the
string by another letter. Recall from Exercise 3.4 that there is a standard boolean-valued
function Character.isLetter(char) that can be used to test whether its parameter is a
letter. There is another standard char-valued function, Character.toUpperCase(char),
that returns a capitalized version of the single character passed to it as a parameter. That
is, if the parameter is a letter, it returns the upper-case version. If the parameter is not a
letter, it just returns a copy of the parameter.

Notes: TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
